Potential improvements or additional features

## Have map marker clicks navigate to a linked page instead of display a popup

In order to provide a different form of navigation, change the marker click action to navigate to a page referenced instead of displaying a popup. As the popup still would have value, convert the popup display to be triggered when hovering over the marker instead of on click.

This can be accomplished as described [here](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/display-a-popup-on-hover/).

## Animate highlighting places along a trip

The libremap SDK allows for animation along a route - it could be interesting to allow a roadtrip to have an animation highlighting the visited places in order.

The framework would look something like what is outlined [here](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/animate-point-along-route).
