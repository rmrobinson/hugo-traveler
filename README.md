# hugo traveler theme

This theme is designed to make it easy for someone to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build a website that has content which is spatially related. This theme was originally built to visualize trips which have been taken on maps, though other uses could apply as well.

This project is made significantly easier when using an SVG map; [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/) is a great source of freely licensed SVG maps which this theme can take advantage of.

NOTE: some of the SVG maps have the incorrect capitalization of the viewbox label (it should be viewBox). Incorrect casing will prevent the map from properly resizing when the browser window changes - simply rename the element to fix this.
