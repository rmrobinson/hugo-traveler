# hugo traveler theme

This theme is designed to make it easy for someone to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build a website with content that is spatially related. This theme was originally built to showcase trips which have been taken alongside a map of the trip, to make it easier for a reader to follow along with the trip, however this could be used for other purposes as well.

This project assumes that the content will relate to a map that is available in the form of an SVG graphic; [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/) is a great source of freely licensed SVG maps which this theme can take advantage of.

NOTE: some of the SVG maps provided by simplemaps have the incorrect capitalization of the viewbox label (it should be viewBox, not viewbox). Incorrect casing will prevent the map from properly resizing when the browser window changes - simply rename the element to fix this.
